Shell module to create repositories more easily and fast, with configurations for diverse cases.

A shell module to repositories and connect easily and fast with the possibility to connect it to a remote repo, with configuration for diverse cases like node, python and web development, etc. This automatic repositories includes the basic files: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.github` folder, `src` folder and `.editorconfig`.

## Background

The idea of this project came to me while I was practicing programming, as I am still a 17-year-old student, I usually do a lot of small projects to practice coding, and upload them to github in case it can be useful to others. So after doing some projects I realized that I always created the same files and then executed the same commands at the beginning of each project, so I decided to make a module for shell that would create a new repo fast and easy.

## Install

To install the module in your favorite shell, you first need to clone this repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/LuckJMG/newrepo
```

Then execute this command to put this alias in your shell config file:

``` shell
# If using bash
echo 'alias newrepo="$DIR_NEWREPO/src/main.sh" >> ~/.bashrc'

# If using zsh
echo 'alias newrepo="$DIR_NEWREPO/src/main.sh" >> ~/.zshrc'
```

Replace `$DIR_NEWREPO` with the direction of the cloned repository.

## Usage

Once installed you can create repositories more easily.

The newrepo command is formed by 4  parts: the call of the command, the type of repository, the name of repository and the connection to a remote repository.

``` shell
newrepo -type name url
```

The most basic command is:

``` shell
newrepo name
```

This command will create a repo with all the basic files and folders without extras, but there are several other options that are mentioned in this table:

| Type | Description | Contents |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| `--standard` | Standard: Repository standardization | [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [Standard README](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) and [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)  |
| `--node` | Node: Repository made for coding with node. | npm init -y |
| `--web`| Web: Repository made for web development. | index file, css folder, js folder and img folder |
| `--python` | Python: Repository for python development. | setup file, sample folder with init and core files, and test folder |
| `--minimalist` | Minimalist: Only essential files. | .md files and license |

Also, if you before created a github repository, you can link the local repo to the remote repo in the same command that creates the local repo:

``` shell
newrepo name url
```

The only thing you should change is in the license, the username to your name, in the `LICENSE` file and at the end of the `README.md` file.

## Thanks
