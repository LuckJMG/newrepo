## Background

**Status:** Optional.

**Requirements:**

- Cover motivation.
- Cover abstract dependencies.
- Cover intellectual provenance: A `See Also` section is also fitting.

## Install

**Status:** Required by default, optional for [documentation repositories](#definitions).

**Requirements:**

- Code block illustrating how to install.

**Subsections:**

- `Dependencies`. Required if there are unusual dependencies or dependencies that must be manually installed.

**Suggestions:**

- Link to prerequisite sites for programming language: [npmjs](https://npmjs.com), [godocs](https://godoc.org), etc.
- Include any system-specific information needed for installation.
- An `Updating` section would be useful for most packages, if there are multiple versions which the user may interface with.

## Usage

**Status:** Required by default, optional for [documentation repositories](#definitions).

**Requirements:**

- Code block illustrating common usage.
- If CLI compatible, code block indicating common usage.
- If importable, code block indicating both import functionality and usage.

**Subsections:**

- `CLI`. Required if CLI functionality exists.

**Suggestions:**

- Cover basic choices that may affect usage: for instance, if JavaScript, cover promises/callbacks, ES6 here.
- If relevant, point to a runnable file for the usage code.

## Thanks

**Status**: Optional.

**Requirements:**

- Must be called `Thanks`, `Credits` or `Acknowledgements`.

**Suggestions:**

- State anyone or anything that significantly helped with the development of your project.
- State public contact hyper-links if applicable.

## Contributing

**Status**: Required.

**Requirements:**

- State where users can ask questions.
- State whether PRs are accepted.
- List any requirements for contributing; for instance, having a sign-off on commits.

**Suggestions:**

- Link to a CONTRIBUTING file -- if there is one.
- Be as friendly as possible.
- Link to the GitHub issues.
- Link to a Code of Conduct. A CoC is often in the Contributing section or document, or set elsewhere for an entire organization, so it may not be necessary to include the entire file in each repository. However, it is highly recommended to always link to the code, wherever it lives.
- A subsection for listing contributors is also welcome here.
